## Foundations (1940sâ€“1950s):
- Early thinkers like Alan Turing, John von Neumann, and Claude Shannon built the theoretical and mathematical groundwork for AI.
- Neural network concepts and the Turing Test emerged.

## Birth of AI (1956)
- The Dartmouth Conference officially launched the field of Artificial Intelligence.
- Early optimism inspired foundational programs like Logic Theorist and ELIZA.

## AI Winters (1970sâ€“1980s):
- Progress slowed due to limited computing power and overhyped expectations, leading to reduced funding and research.
- Machine Learning Era (1990sâ€“2010s)
- Shift from symbolic reasoning to data-driven learning.
- Algorithms like SVMs and neural networks gained traction.
- Major milestone: Deep Blue defeated Garry Kasparov (1997).

## Deep Learning Revolution (2010sâ€“2020s):
- Breakthroughs with CNNs, RNNs, and Transformers.
- Landmark moments: AlphaGo (2016), BERT (2018), GPT-3 (2020).

## Generative AI Era (2022â€“Present):
- Rise of systems like ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and Stable Diffusion.
- AI became creative, multi-modal, and widely accessible.

## Agentic AI (2024â€“Future):
- AI evolves into autonomous, goal-driven agents capable of reasoning, planning, and executing tasks.
- Examples: AutoGPT, Devin, and GPT agents.
